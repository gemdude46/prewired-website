<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Prewired</h1>
<h2>{{*}}</h2>
  <post><name>Q: </name>What is Prewired?</post><br><br>
  <post class=answer>Prewired is an Edinburgh programming club for the under 19's. If your child has shown an interest in learning to code, or just always seems to be on the computer, then theyll probably get a lot out of coming to Prewired. We let the young people guide their own learning, and support them by answering questions and pointing them at the right resources.
We have no lower limit on age or ability, so long as your child is enthusiastic about coding is comfortable learning independently or in a semi-supervised way with a computer. (We don't have the capacity to look after very young children who are not able to engage).</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>Prewired offers an unstructured but supportive environment for under 19s to explore and learn about computer programming and related topics.
We have mentors from university and industry with a wide variety of skills, who volunteer their time, because they love to teach young people about computing. Occasionally we run structured workshops to introduce attendees to a new topic they may not have considered before. Sometimes we hold hackathons, where the kids are challenged to meet specific goals in a set amount of time; this is a really fun learning experience, with concrete outcomes. Sometimes we form teams to take part in national events like the First Lego League or Young Rewired State. You'll hear about these if you sign up to the newsletter. Prewired is also a place for young people to meet peers with shared interests which they can develop together. For some, it can be difficult to interest their friends and family in computing which may be isolating. It can be hard to figure out where to go next when there's no-one you can ask. We want to let young people know that there's a huge community of like-minded people who are waiting to welcome them with open arms.</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>Do I need to register?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>Yes. We need to know who is coming so we can collect emergency contact information etc.
Participants can book places for individual Prewired sessions on Eventbrite here, but must sign up for membership first.</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>When is Prewired?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>5:00 to 7:30 on Wednesday (including school holidays!)</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>Where is Prewired?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>The CodeBase, 3 Lady Lawson Street, Edinburgh. (near the Castle Terrace car park and not far from the Royal Lyceum Theatre.)</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q:</name>Can parents attend too?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>Parents and guardians are welcome, but not obliged, to accompany their child/children to a Prewired session if you think this would benefit them. They will otherwise be fully supervised at all times by volunteers from local community groups, companies and universities.</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>What is provided and what do you need to bring?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>If you can bring your own laptop, please do: but we have some spares, please ask a Mentor. if you want to bring something else: eg. a Rasberry Pi, Aurduino or LEGO Mindstorms, feel free to bring them too. fruit juice and snack is provided, but you can also bring your own(but please dont eat or drink near the computers!) But the most important thing is enthusiasm. you might know everything, or nothing but all you need is to be exited about doing some coding!</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>Why do you do this?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>Many schools do not yet offer appropriate computing classes, and curricula that do exist can be patchy. The technology industry is an ever growing one, and at the moment there are more software engineering (and similar) jobs in world than there are people qualified to fill them. It would be terrible if gifted and enthusiastic young people were deterred from pursuing computing qualifications and roles because they were never aware of the opportunities available, and it's too important and urgent to wait for schools to catch up.But learning to code doesn't only qualify you to be a coder. As our world becomes increasingly technologically-oriented, understanding the process of creating the software that powers our daily lives becomes crucial for everyone. Becoming an empowered digital citizen - or professional in another industry - allows people navigate their rights and responsibilities and make informed decisions about the products and services they use, or provide to others. We think technology can help us towards a better world, but only if future generations understand the opportunities it brings and the impact it can have.</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>How can I help?</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>you could become a mentor, as we're always looking for new helpers. Helping young people learn to code is hugely rewarding. If you can offer your time for two hours at 5.30pm on a Wednesday evening, we'd love to hear from you! We'd prefer it if you drop us an email before showing up, so we know who to expect - hello [at] prewired [dot] org. any hardware of software experiance is welcome, as prewired attendees work on everything from Scratch and Python basics to Minecraft mods and Front-end web development. (also see the "mentors" page.) You could also sponsor, as Prewired is run by a group of volunteers on a shoestring budget. this doesn't nessicarily mean donating money, as it could involve you or the company you work for donating old laptops or mabye prizes for the Hackathons (it doesn't need to be something fancy.) please make sure you agree with our Sponsor's Policy before you do.</post><br><br>
<post><name>Q: </name>How is Prewired organised/structured</post><br><br>
<post class=answer>Prewired is a loose-knit group run by volunteers with no budget. There is a core group of primary organisers (Amy Guy, Ewan Klein and Freda O'Byrne), and a broader organising committee (organisers, plus Eder Coelho Paula, Stuart Roebuck, Rikki Guy and Martha Gilmore) who meet monthly and take decisions together.  We're in the process of becoming an SCIO with a board. If you're interested in talking to us about this, or getting involved with the organisation process, please get in touch!</post><br><br>
