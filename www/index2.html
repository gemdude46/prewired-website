        <h3>
          Equipment
        </h3>

        <p id=equip>
          Not all of the young people who come to Prewired bring their own laptops. We have a few donated spares that attendees can borrow. Does your company have spare or old laptops lying around that could ues a good home? Or buy us some cheap ones whe can put Ubuntu on?
        </p>

        <h3>
          Catering
        </h3>

        <p id=food>
          Every session we provide juice and light snacks for our attendees to keep them going and and them have a break. Currently volunteers take turns at buying these.<br><br>For certain special events and hackathonswe'd like to provide light lunch daily.<br><br>
            &bull;£60 per month can cover the snacks overhead.<br>
            &bull;£150 can provide light lunch and snacks for 20 kids for one day of a special event.

          If you're a company with employees to spare on Wednesday evenings, send them along to the CodeBase mentor!

        <p id=coach>
          Annually we take part in the <u>Young Rewired State</u>, wich culminates in a gathering of hundreds of young people at one location in the UK. Depending on where, a coach can cost between &pound;400 and &pound;1000 for the whole group, and we don't want any kids to miss out because they can cover their share.

        <h3>
          Prizes
        </h3>

        <p id=prizes>
          Sometime we hold special hackathons, usually in the Easter Holidays, and we want to give out small prizes for the projects the young people work on. Nothing expensive, just a token of appreciation. Programming books? A fancy gaming mouse? Geeky t-shirts? Suggestions ans contributions are very welcome!
        </p>

        <h3>
          Work Experience
        </h3>

        <p id=work>
          Many of our young people are at secondary school and have mandatory work experience coming up. These usually last one week. Some of the placements can be pretty rubbish. We think it would be really beneficial to be able to send them to a software company rather than something they’re not really interested in. Can your company host an enthusiastic young coder for a week in spring/summer? We’re building up a database so that we can pair young people with good placements when the time comes. <u>Read more here</u>

Where our mentors make recommendations, they are based on merit alone.<br><br>We wish to support independant thinking of our participants, and will not support advertising targeted at them. We refrain from asking for or handing out branded merchandise or marketing material from any of our sponsors, except where products are of particular use or benefit to participants. We hope that sponsors choose to support us for the benefit of the participants and the positive impact our activities may have on their future, rather than for personal, organisational or commercial gain.<br><br>We continue to be grateful for any support we have been given, financially or in-kind. Without this we couldn’t sustain our offerings or aim to grow in the future.
