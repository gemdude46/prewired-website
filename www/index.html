    How to Join
            </h2>
            <p>

    You or a parent sign up for the newsletter using the form below, so you don't miss out on any announcements.
    Register for membership (it's free!), leaving your emergency contact details and any special requirements.
    Book your place each week for our sessions using Eventbrite.
    Turn up!<br>
      &bull;If you have never coded before, or have but don't know what to do, no problem! Introduce yourself to the Duty Mentor (who should be easy to spot) when you arrive, and they'll help you to get started.<br>
      &bull;If you're already working on a coding project (maybe you're building your own website), or learning a topic by yourself and are happy to carry on with that, cool beans. Make yourself at home and ask a question.
